## Solution

Let *H(n)* be the probability that the game is not over after *n* tosses and that the *n*th toss is HEAD. 

Let $$T(n)$$ be the probability that the game is not over after $$n$$ tosses and that the $$n$$th toss is TAIL.

Let $$L(n)$$ be the probablity that the game is over right after $$n$$ tosses.

It can be seen that
- $$H(n) = T(n-1) \times \frac{1}{2}$$
- $$T(n) = $$
