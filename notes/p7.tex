\problem[7]{Find the 10001st Prime}

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10001st prime number?

\solution

While the scale of the problem is small and a simple trial division algorithm would produce the answer in no time, we present here a slightly better algorithm that employs the Sieve of Eratosthenes method.

A key result that enables us to implement a sieving method is the following inequality regarding the $n$th prime number, $p_n$:
\[
n \ln n + n \ln \ln n - n < p_n < n \ln n + n \ln \ln n \text{ for $n \ge 6$}.
\]
This inequality provides an upper bound on the numbers that need to be sieved to find the $n$th prime. What follows is just the standard Sieve of Eratosthenes.

\answer

104743

\complexity

Time complexity: $\BigO(n \ln n)$

Space complexity: $\BigO(n \ln n)$
